This repository contains the Python script that implements the Smith Waterman algorithm to produce a sequence alignment. The program will read two sequences from two files and print the alignment to the screen. The algorithm is simplified in that it only needs to use a basic scoring method, regardless of the nature of the sequences being aligned. The scores are: match (+1), mismatch (-1) and gap (-1).
